# Mod Choice Reasoning

Explains why I chose one mod over another

# One Probe vs WAILA

Must be reinvestigated when mods are added.

- Both had negligable performance impact
- Both show pretty much the same info
- WAILA has been forked and is under different ownership
- WAILA doesn't add any blocks. No one is going to craft the TOP stuff realistically
- One Probe has more integrated mod support
- One Probe doesn't need a separate mod for harvestability. Less dependencies

# JourneyMap vs Xaero's Minimap

- Both had the same performance impact
- JourneyMap has more downloads, thus more people are familiar with it
- JourneyMap hides parts of the map you can't actually see
