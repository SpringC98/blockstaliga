# Mod Choice Reasoning

Explains why I chose one mod over another

# One Probe vs WAILA

Must be reinvestigated when mods are added.

- Both had negligable performance impact
- Both show pretty much the same info
- WAILA has been forked and is under different ownership
- WAILA doesn't add any blocks. No one is going to craft the TOP stuff realistically
- One Probe has more integrated mod support
- One Probe doesn't need a separate mod for harvestability. Less dependencies

# JourneyMap vs Xaero's Minimap

- Both had the same performance impact
- JourneyMap has more downloads, thus more people are familiar with it
- JourneyMap hides parts of the map you can't actually see
- JourneyMap spews errors all over the place

# Hunger Overhaul

I removed this mod because it's very agressive. If you wanted to run a real
tough survival playthrough this would be essential. However with the main focus
of this pack being tech, and with Spice of Life forcing variation in meals well
enough, I think this can be left out.

# Tech Reborn/IC2

Standardising power systems is a major problem late game. With the amount of
content added by both these mods of which most players won't use in favour of
the other mods I have in this pack, there is no point adding them to the game.

There is nothing in either of the mods that can't be crafted already.

# WR CBE

There are utilities in RFTools to cover this
