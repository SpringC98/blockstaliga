# Mod Choice Reasoning

Explains why I chose one mod over another

# One Probe vs WAILA

Must be reinvestigated when mods are added.

- Both had negligable performance impact
- Both show pretty much the same info
- WAILA has been forked and is under different ownership
- WAILA doesn't add any blocks. No one is going to craft the TOP stuff realistically
- One Probe has more integrated mod support
- One Probe doesn't need a separate mod for harvestability. Less dependencies

# JourneyMap vs Xaero's Minimap

- Both had the same performance impact
- JourneyMap has more downloads, thus more people are familiar with it
- JourneyMap hides parts of the map you can't actually see
- JourneyMap spews errors all over the place

# Hunger Overhaul

I removed this mod because it's very agressive. If you wanted to run a real
tough survival playthrough this would be essential. However with the main focus
of this pack being tech, and with Spice of Life forcing variation in meals well
enough, I think this can be left out.

# Tech Reborn/IC2

Standardising power systems is a major problem late game. With the amount of
content added by both these mods of which most players won't use in favour of
the other mods I have in this pack, there is no point adding them to the game.

There is nothing in either of the mods that can't be crafted already.

# WR CBE

There are utilities in RFTools to cover this

# Compact Machines

It's using an outdated COFHLib and I can't enable it safely. I will certainly
be adding it if is updated.

# Classic Combat

Not added because it's not actually wholly effective at disabling the
new combat. There is still the long swing animations.

# Extra Utilities 2

It is currently very incomplete. It adds 2 dimensions, 1 of which is exclusive
to the quantum quarry. The regular ender quarry is gone so stripping the deep
dark is no longer a thing. The in game documentation is not up to date.
Everything else is present in other mods.

# EU Elevators

Not needed because OpenBlocks has elevators

# Iron Chests

Use barrels for early game storage, and then just get yourself some AE2 storage
